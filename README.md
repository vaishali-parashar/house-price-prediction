It is a Advanced Problem of Regression which requires advanced techniques of feature engineering, feature selection and extraction, modelling, model evaluation, and Statistics.


Description


Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.


Goal


It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
